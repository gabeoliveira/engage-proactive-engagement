# Use Case

This solution creates a bridge between **Twilio Engage** and **Twilio Flex**, creating automated WhatsApp engagements from a User Journey on Engage depending on a pre-defined trigger. It's particularly useful for:

* Lead Conversion
* Customer Support

## Business Value

Engaging customers or leads automatically decreases the response time and therefore helps increasing lead conversion. It also saves agents time as they don't have to create conversations manually and wait for customers' replies.
